											<h2>Seed MMO</h2>
											<p>Simulating the future of humanity</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											Seed is a persistent MMO simulation where the player's goal is to take over a vast planet, help
											rebuild civilisation among thousands of players and characters, to ensure the survival of humanity.
										</p>
										<p>
											The game aims to bring together thousands of players to build vast communities in a Sims-like fashion with 
											many more complexities and mechanics, with tools to achieve self-sustainability on a new planet. To find out more, 
											check out Seed's <a href="https://www.seed-online.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>.

												<h3>Built to scale with <a href="https://ims.improbable.io/products/spatialos" target="_blank">Spatial OS</a></h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Seed is a single-shard MMO, meaning that it should be possible for each player to interact with all others, in a 
												consistent world, with no loading times jumping between servers. This technology is made possible by 
												<a href="https://ims.improbable.io/products/spatialos" target="_blank">Spatial OS</a>, being 
												developed by <a href="https://www.improbable.io/" target="_blank">Improbable</a>.

												<h3>Persistent gameplay</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Each seedling is continuously simulated in Seed, even when you're not at your computer. <br>
												Micro-management is tedious in an online world of thousands of players. While it is possible to do so, each seedling 
												can also be indirectly controlled via calendars, production schedules, life-work balance needs and its personality 
												traits. That unlocks the possibility of relaxing and letting the AI do the work.
