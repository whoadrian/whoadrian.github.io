											<h2>Shrapnel</h2>
											<p>SHRAPNEL is an intensely competitive AAA extraction shooter, launching in 2025 and currently in early access, with servers being deployed regularly.</p>
										</header>
										<p>
											In 2040, scientists discovered that material refined from Shrapnel allows behaviors that occur in quantum mechanics to manifest into the realm of classical physics. 
											Chance can be manipulated, objects can become physically linked despite being separate, and even the relationship between cause and effect can be flipped. 
											VALDACHA CORP. (V-Corp) cornered the market for this new lucrative tech, resulting in massive MEF wars. Now, in 2044, the fight rages.

												<h3>Developing the Audio & Tools</h3>
											</header>

											<p>
												The sound design & audio integration of Shrapnel is fully owned by Rev Rooms, a co-dev studio specializing in game audio.
												The combined experience of the Rev Rooms designers & coders enables every team to push the audio implementation even further than in-house audio departments.<br>
											</p>

											<p>
												The Shrapnel audio team consists of myself - the audio coder - three sound designers and one producer. 
											</p>

											<p>
												<h1>Stack:</h1> Unreal Engine 5.4 | Wwise | C++ | Python | Rider | Perforce | Jenkins
											</p>

											<p>
												<h1>We handle everything audio:</h1>
											</p>

											<ul>
												<ul>
													<li><u>Runtime systems</u> built alongside Wwise that can handle event prioritisation, actor streaming & pooling, hundreds of rooms & portals, as well as runtime detection of spaces</li>
													<li><u>Sound design & integration</u> using Wwise's toolkit, from basic event-based playback to systems-driven ambiences & accurate 3D spatialization using Audio Objects</li>
													<li><u>Custom plugins</u> developed around the combined experience of the Rev Rooms teams, massively speeding up the initial integration of common audio systems & workflows</li>
													<li><u>Editor tools & workflows</u> that make the audio integration smoother, focused on the designer's experience, such as custom widgets, level bulk operations, validation & debugging tools</li>
												</ul>
