											<h2>Velawoods English</h2>
											<p>English courses designed with interactive and immersive learning experiences, aligned to internationally recognised qualifications from Cambridge University.</p>
										</header>

										<p>
											Velawoods is an educational first-person game devised jointly with Cambridge University Press and Learn Direct,
											featuring a 3D world in which the user interacts with its characters through speech analysis software provided by Carnegie Speech, and 
											completes various mini-games carefully designed to go hand-in-hand with English coursebooks.
										</p>

										<p>
											A number of English courses for different levels are available to download as modules, and, at the end of each, the player receives an internationally 
											recognised certificate of completion.
											Velawoods is available on Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. To find out more about the educational game, 
											check out its <a href="https://www.velawoodsenglish.com/home/" target="_blank">official website</a>.

												<h3>Developing Velawoods</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Velawoods was my very first professional career step after university, in 2014! I was lucky to time it just right - when I joined the company, we were only 2 developers who 
												kick-started the project and set up the initial scaffolding. 
											</p>

											<p>
												Eventually the team grew to about 30 developers, artists and designers, as new courses had to be developed in 
												parallel, and aiming for a release in 2015. Some of the systems I helped build were the timeline-based dialogues 
												between the player and the characters, handling the API to the Carnegie Speech servers and displaying the feedback on each spoken word to the user, 
												a large number of in-game activities, core mechanics and UI.
											</p>

											<p>
												After release, we had over 20.000 users providing feedback in the first few months, and we were regularly 
												delivering fixes and new content. In 2016, with the game being well received, I decided to leave 
												UK and travel, settling in Bucharest where I got to work next on <a href="/black-the-fall.html">Black The Fall</a>.
